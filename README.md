# 👋 Hi, I'm Guillaume Routier

Welcome to my GitHub profile — a space where I share projects at the intersection of **quantitative finance**, **machine learning**, and **algorithmic trading**.

## 🧠 About Me
- Currently enrolled in the **Master 2 Probabilité et Finance (ex-DEA El Karoui)** at École Polytechnique & Sorbonne Université.
- Quantitative research intern at **BNP Paribas Asset Managemetn**, working on alpha signal in the equity market.
- Passionate about **stochastic processes**, **numerical methods**, and **optimal decision-making under uncertainty**.

## 📌 Selected Projects

### [Deep Optimal Stopping](https://github.com/Guillaumertr/Deep-Optimal-Stopping)
> Neural network-based solution to optimal stopping problems in high dimensions. Illustrates the power of deep learning for control tasks.

### [Advanced Option Pricing](https://github.com/Guillaumertr/Advanced-Option-Pricing-Models)
> Pricing American options via regression (polynomial, Hermite, augmented) and deep neural networks. Includes comparison with benchmark models.

> Learn optimal hedging strategies via PyTorch-based neural networks under transaction costs. A modern approach to risk management.

> Complete tree-based pricing framework with backward induction and Monte Carlo rollout simulation.

### [Bid-Ask Replication with Leland Volatility](https://github.com/Guillaumertr/Bid-Ask-Replication)
> Replicating options under transaction costs using adjusted volatility from Leland’s model. Includes exact hedging simulation and cost analysis.

### [Barrier Option Pricing](https://github.com/Guillaumertr/Barrier-Option-Pricing)
> Accurate valuation using the law of the max of Brownian motion, avoiding naive Monte Carlo pitfalls when near the barrier.

### [Variance Reduction Techniques](https://github.com/Guillaumertr/Variance-Reduction)
> Classical tools like control variates and antithetic sampling implemented from scratch for Monte Carlo pricing.

### [Rejection Sampling Method](https://github.com/Guillaumertr/Rejection-method)
> Simple yet powerful demonstration of how to simulate complex distributions using rejection sampling.
