## 🧠 About Me
- 🎓 Currently enrolled in the **Master 2 Probabilité et Finance (ex-DEA El Karoui)** at École Polytechnique & Sorbonne Université.
- 🏦 Former quantitative intern at **J.P. Morgan**, working on operational risk modeling.
- 🔬 Passionate about **stochastic processes**, **numerical methods**, and **optimal decision-making under uncertainty**.
- 🤖 Currently exploring **deep reinforcement learning** and **hedging under market frictions**.

## 📌 Selected Projects

### 🔬 [Deep Optimal Stopping](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name)
> Neural network-based solution to optimal stopping problems in high dimensions. Illustrates the power of deep learning for control tasks.

### 🧮 [Longstaff-Schwartz Option Pricing](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name)
> Pricing American options via regression (polynomial, Hermite, augmented) and deep neural networks. Includes comparison with benchmark models.

### 🤖 [Deep Hedging](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name)
> Learn optimal hedging strategies via PyTorch-based neural networks under transaction costs. A modern approach to risk management.

### 📉 [Bid-Ask Replication with Leland Volatility](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name)
> Replicating options under transaction costs using adjusted volatility from Leland’s model. Includes exact hedging simulation and cost analysis.

### 🌐 [Barrier Option Pricing](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name)
> Accurate valuation using the law of the max of Brownian motion, avoiding naive Monte Carlo pitfalls when near the barrier.

### 🏛️ [Binomial Tree Pricing](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name)
> Complete tree-based pricing framework with backward induction and Monte Carlo rollout simulation.

### 💡 [Variance Reduction Techniques](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name)
> Classical tools like control variates and antithetic sampling implemented from scratch for Monte Carlo pricing.

### 🎲 [Rejection Sampling Method](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name)
> Simple yet powerful demonstration of how to simulate complex distributions using rejection sampling.
